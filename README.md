ASP.NET Core and Angular Project with JSON File Database
This project is a web application developed using ASP.NET Core for the backend, Angular for the frontend, and a JSON file as a database. It's developed in Visual Studio 2019, combining the power of ASP.NET Core and Angular to create a modern web application with data storage managed through a JSON file.

Overview
The project utilizes ASP.NET Core for the server-side functionalities, Angular for the client-side interface, and a JSON file as a lightweight database for storing and updating data. This setup provides a scalable and efficient solution for managing data in a web application without the need for a traditional database server.
